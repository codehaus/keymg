=================
Use of GPG
=================

Codehaus requires the builds to incorporate gpg and the jars to be signed.

You will see that you are forced to enter your gpg passphrase frequently.

You can avoid this with the option:
mvn verify -Dgpg.passphrase=thephrase
or provide -Dgpg.passphrase=thephrase
